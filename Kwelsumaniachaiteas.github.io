    <h1>Will You Be Mine?</h1>
    <p>In sands of beaches with sunsets that shine,</p>
    <p>Will you be mine, my Duchess divine?</p>
    <p>With chocolate sweet, your cravings align,</p>
    <p>And I with French fries, a love so fine.</p>
    <p>Your smile, a beacon, brings joy to my heart,</p>
    <p>Together, forever, we'll never part.</p>
    <p>For in your arms, I've found my true home,</p>
    <p>A love that blooms, no matter where we roam.</p>
    <p>So, Viscount am I, and Duchess are you,</p>
    <p>A love so pure, forever it's true.</p>
    <p>With you by my side, my heart's filled with glee,</p>
    <p>Will you be mine, and forever with me?</p>
